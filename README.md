# Aneta Webbie Portfolio Page

We have learnt a lot of new information this week and have done a number of small exercises and projects. Now is time to combine the knowledge you have gained and create a more complex real-world looking page. You will create a page "Aneta Webbie Portfolio Page", which is a personal portfolio page of a web developer called Aneta Webbie. You are provided with a design of the page - Page Design. The design is for a desktop version only as we are yet to learn about responsive layouts.

Check all the parts of the design carefully and recreate the same layout. **If you want, you can change the text, images, fonts, and colors, but stick to the same layout as it is in the template.**

**You do not have to finish the whole website today.** But get started and ask questions, so that afterward you can continue working on your own!

Colors Palette used in the provided design:

* Green: #54be90
* White: #ffffff
* Light grey: #ebebeb
* Text grey: #444444
* Dark grey: #232323

Font (or you can use some other, choice is yours!):

[Alegreya Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Alegreya+Sans) in regular, bold and extra-bold style

## Milestone 1: Project set up

1. Create a GitHub project for your portfolio.
2. Set up the project so it has `index.html`, `css` folder with `style.css` and `img` folder.
3. Commit and push often.

## Milestone 2: HTML

1. Link stylesheet to the HTML document.
2. Add a font link to the HTML document.
3. Get familiar with the design of [Aneta Webbie Portfolio Page](https://github.com/AndreaDvorakova/CodingBootcamp_Aneta_Webbie/blob/main/Aneta%20Webie%20Page%20Design.png), notice how the page is split into sections, think of which tags are used and for what, where flexbox is used, etc.
4. Go to Pixabay or similar sites to find images that you need, or you can use your own. All images should be in img folder. Try to use SVG icons since you can change their colors like you did in Car exercise or with CSS.
5. Now that you have everything set up and are familiar with design, you can start coding! **Write the HTML structure of the page.** Try to follow the best practices we learnt this week - name all classes using BEM.
6. In navigation links put link path so the page scrolls to a certain section.
7. Add alternative text to the images.
8. If you need help with the form check [HTML forms](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp). Notice different input types, as well as the difference between label and placeholder.

## Milestone 3: CSS

1. Now that you finished writing HTML structure, **you can move on to styling**!
2. Try to follow the best practices we learnt this week - BEM methodology & other ways to structure your CSS
3. Add classes to the elements that you want to style.
4. Use the flexbox for the layout.
5. Make navigation in a way so that it will stick to the top of the page when scrolling.
6. All of the links should have some hover effects. It can be a color change, box-shadow change, different opacity, underline, etc.
7. The last project in My Portfolio section should be highlighted, which means that it should have some additional styles.
